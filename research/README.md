# ðŸ”¬ Research

Welcome to the research section of the **D&D RAG Exploration** project.
This directory serves as the experimental laboratory where we investigate, prototype, and validate various RAG techniques and approaches.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Context

This research directory supports the broader project goal of creating an intelligent D&D assistant through systematic exploration of RAG optimization techniques.

## ðŸ“Š Research Structure

The research is organized into two complementary categories, each addressing different aspects of RAG system development:

### ðŸ”§ Engineering

The engineering category focuses on **practical implementation concerns** and **operational excellence**.

Here we explore:

- Framework & Tool Evaluation
- Scalability & Performance
- Observability & Monitoring
- Developer Experience

### ðŸ§  Theoretical

The theoretical category focuses on **algorithmic innovation** and **technique optimization**.

Research here includes:

- Core RAG Optimization
- Advanced RAG Techniques
- Knowledge Representation
- Agentic Workflows
- Reasoning & Uncertainty
