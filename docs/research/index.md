# üî¨ Research Documentation

Welcome to the research documentation for the **D&D RAG Exploration** project. This section provides comprehensive insights into our experimental approaches, methodologies, and findings in advancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques for tabletop gaming.

## üéØ Research Overview

Our research is systematically organized into two complementary categories, each addressing different aspects of RAG system development and optimization:

**Active Projects:**

- [Traditional RAG Implementation](00_traditional-rag/langgraph.md) - Foundational RAG system using LangGraph
