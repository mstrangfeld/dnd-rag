# üî¨ Research Documentation

Welcome to the research documentation for the **D&D RAG Exploration** project. This section provides comprehensive insights into our experimental approaches, methodologies, and findings in advancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques for tabletop gaming.

## üéØ Research Overview

Our research is systematically organized into two complementary categories, each addressing different aspects of RAG system development and optimization:

### üîß Engineering Research

The engineering research track focuses on **practical implementation concerns** and **operational excellence**. Here we evaluate frameworks, optimize performance, and enhance developer experience.

**Current Research Areas:**

- **Framework & Tool Evaluation**: Comparative analysis of RAG frameworks and libraries
- **Scalability & Performance**: Optimization strategies for large-scale D&D knowledge bases  
- **Observability & Monitoring**: Instrumentation and metrics for RAG system health
- **Developer Experience**: Tooling and workflows for efficient RAG development

**Active Projects:**

- [Naive RAG Implementation](engineering/00_naive-rag/langgraph.md) - Foundational RAG system using LangGraph

### üß† Theoretical Research

The theoretical research track focuses on **algorithmic innovation** and **technique optimization**. This is where we push the boundaries of what's possible with RAG systems.

**Research Areas:**

- **Core RAG Optimization**: Advanced chunking strategies, embedding models, and retrieval methods
- **Advanced RAG Techniques**: Query expansion, agentic tool use, and multi-step reasoning
- **Knowledge Representation**: Graph-based systems and temporal knowledge modeling
- **Agentic Workflows**: Long-term memory and persistent context management
- **Reasoning & Uncertainty**: Confidence scoring and causal inference capabilities

**Coming Soon:**

- Multi-hop reasoning for complex D&D queries
- Temporal knowledge graphs for campaign progression
- Theory of mind modeling for player assistance

## üé≤ Why D&D for RAG Research?

Dungeons & Dragons provides an exceptional testbed for advanced RAG techniques because of its unique characteristics:

- **Complex Domain Knowledge**: Interconnected rules, lore, and mechanical systems
- **Ambiguous Natural Language**: Players use imprecise terminology requiring semantic understanding
- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Questions often require synthesizing information from multiple sources
- **Temporal Context**: Game narratives evolve over time, requiring dynamic knowledge updates
- **Personalization Needs**: Each campaign has unique house rules and narrative contexts

## üìñ Research Methodology

Our research follows a rigorous experimental approach:

1. **Hypothesis Formation**: Clear problem statements and expected outcomes
2. **Implementation**: Practical prototypes with measurable components
3. **Evaluation**: Quantitative metrics and qualitative assessment
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive findings and reproducible methods
5. **Iteration**: Continuous improvement based on results
